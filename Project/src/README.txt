Implement a matrix multiplication subroutine.
– 𝑌𝑌 = 𝐴𝐴 × 𝐵𝐵
• Both 𝐴𝐴 and 𝐵𝐵 are 𝑛𝑛 by 𝑛𝑛 matrices of unsigned integers.
– 𝑛𝑛 and all the elements of 𝐴𝐴 and 𝐵𝐵 will be given.
• Then, you compute 𝑌𝑌 = 𝐴𝐴 × 𝐵𝐵 and store the result in the memory.

Final Outcome
• It uses the four LEDs (LD3, LD2, LD1, LD0) and 7-seg to indicate 
the final outcome.
• It turns on LD0 right before it starts the matrix multiplication. (7-seg 
is OFF)
• If the final answer is wrong, LD3 and LD0 are turned on. (7-seg 
shows the runtime in HEX).
• If the final answer is correct, all the LEDs are turned on. (7-seg 
shows the runtime in HEX)
